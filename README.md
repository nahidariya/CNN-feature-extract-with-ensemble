  # Tea leaf disease detection through the fusion of ensemble and deep learning 
This project combines both deep learning and machine learning. At first feature is extracted using popular deep learning model CNN. and then classified using four machine learning(SVM, KNN, RF, XGBoost), after that ensemble technique is applied. I used Hard Voting, Soft Voting and Stacking classifiers for ensemble method.
